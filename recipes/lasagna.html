<p>Cooking Instructions:
    <ol>
    <h3>Heat the oven to 400F</h3>
    <h3>Brown the beef and onions</h3>
    <li>Finely chop 1 medium yellow onion. Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in your skillet over medium high heat until shimmering. Add the chopped onion
        1 lb lean ground beef, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, and cook, breaking the beef into small pieces
        with the wooden spoon until the beef is cooked through. It should take 6-8 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <h3>Prepare the baking dish and assemble the meat sauce</h3>
    <li>Spread thin layer of the marinara sauve in the bottom of the 9x13 inch baking dish. Stir remaining sauce into the ground beef mixture</li>
    <h3>Begin layering the lasagna</h3>
    <li>Shred 12 oz mozzarella cheese if needed. Place 5 lasagna nodles in the baking dish, break them if you need to.
        Dollop and spread 1 cup of the ricotta cheese over the noodles. Dollop and spread about 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce on the ricotta,
        then sprinkle 1 cup of the mozzarella.
    </li>
    <h3>Continue layering the lasagna</h3>
    <li>Arrange 5 more noodles over the mzzarella, followed by 1 cup of the ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce, and 1 
        cup of the mozzarella. Top with a final layer of 5 noodles and the remaining sauce, spreading the sauce thin so that it almost
        completely covers the noodles. (save one remaining cup of mozzarella for the end of baking.) 
        Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.
    </li>
    <h3>Bake the lasagna for 1 hour</h3>
    <li>While baking, check to make sure the noodles are done by poking the lasagna witha  knife; the knife  should slide 
        easily through all the layers. If it does not, cover and cook for 15 minutes more.
    </li>
    <h3>Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella and finish baking</h3>
    <li>Uncover the lasagna and sprinkle with the remaining cup of mozzarella. Bake while uncovered until the mozzarella is melted
        and slightly browned, and the sauce is bubbling. Should take 8 to 10 minutes more.
    </li>
    <h3>Cool the lasagna for 15 minutes</h3>
</ol>
